Feature: Staff edit an application in progress
As staff I need to be able to edit an application in progress, so that I can assist CV Clients with completing their permit applications and approving issuance.

staff = PC, SA, TRAIN, CTPO

Note: The following rules apply to all permit application types. There are currently no unique staff rules for editing a permit application with the exception of rejected applications and amending permit applications. See related feature files:
