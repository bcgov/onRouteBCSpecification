# GARMs Return Codes
- suggests testing #nextaction 
	- test in TPS test and use the account maintenance screen in GARMS
		- can we get a member of the FIN team that has access to the GARMS test env?
			- may need to engage the GARMS re URL's - Garima will confirm the JIRA ticket
				- Anyone who wants to checkout the wsdl, this is the url: [https://test.egarms.gov.bc.ca/SecuredWS/wsadetail.asmx?wsdl](https://test.egarms.gov.bc.ca/SecuredWS/wsadetail.asmx?wsdl "https://test.egarms.gov.bc.ca/securedws/wsadetail.asmx?wsdl") use it in browser with username as IDIR\TROREGD I can share password privately with whosoever needs it
				- Here is the ticket that has GARM connectivity information: [https://moti-imb.atlassian.net/browse/ORV2-4011](https://moti-imb.atlassian.net/browse/ORV2-4011 "https://moti-imb.atlassian.net/browse/orv2-4011")
			- do you do these in prod GARMS
			- access to test GARMS and TPS Office test, correct roles?
		- Live session
	- need to plan the tests #nextaction 
	- using TPS tests
	- Tests:
		- does it give us the data with the code?
			- Leif believes it does
		- closed account with balance
			- what is returned?
		- over limit using the 9-11 trick
			- send file to GARMs with large transaction
		- does it give back multiple errors at once?
			- inactive account that is also over the limit
				- likely just one code
			- looks like we only get one code at a time but which would we get if there are more than one issue?
- from GARMS list of known accounts to use for testing
	- may be possible to set them up in certain ways 
	- need to confirm if this is in test or dev
	- suggested not to use their dev environment

# Refunds
- Need to figure out the eGARMs and TPS sync issues with regards to refunds
	- is eGARMS the source of truth for status or TPS?
		- if we need to go to eGARMs to do refund screens need to handle eGARMS return codes
	- account status
		- process refund on hold
		- process refund on closed
		- process refund on serious error
	- can we still send a transaction from onRoute to eGARMS?
