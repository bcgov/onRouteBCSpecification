@waitingfor - NicoleH re spacing ranges
Horizontal line issue and spacing between fonts how do we handle the gaps between fonts?

Rule: draw individual axle units after number of axle units is inputted and user tabs to another field

Rule: draw individual axle unit types based on the user number of axles

Rule: draw variable spacing interaxle spacing dimension lines after user inputs interaxle spacing and tabs to another field
